 1. ciw and diw are pretty cool. you don't have to hop back to the word boundary, you can just delete or change the word
 2. `#` and `*` over a word will highlight all occurrences of that word and move backward and forward
 3. t/T and f/F are for hop, basically, and t stops before, f stops on, the character.
 4. `C-r` is redo
 5. Don't forget `o` and `O`, which open a line abovebelow
 6. A gets you to the end of the line and into insert mode
 7. Remember to use your old friends `^` and `$` and their additional buddy `0`
 8. the `%` character in normal mode lets you hop to a bracket's pair
 9. `[m` and `]m` take you to top and bottom of method. 
 10. `g;` and `g,` jump to previous/next change (on change list) 
 11. The quickfix list is `:cl` and `:cc` `:cn` etc. Also there is the local list ll which is like a buffer local quickfix list.
 12. `CTRL-o` and `CTRL-i` to walk the jump list (a list of where you've been in the buffer)
 13. `gi` takes you to your last insert; `gv` the last visual mode selection; `gn` the last search match; `gI` insert text at beginning of line 
 14. in Visual mode, `ip` and `ap` (also `Ip` and `Ap`) take yuou to the paragraph boundaries; you can also config function and class (it's textobj treesitter plugin)
 15. Ranges also matter. Rangers can be:
  - Line numbers
  - The current line, `.`
  - The last line of the current buffer, `$`
  - The entire file, `%`
  - The last selection, `*`
 16. Here are some cool registers:
   - The unnamed register "
   - The read-only registers `.`, `%`, `:`, las:e ~t insert, current filename, most recent command
   - Alternate buffer register `#`
   - Black hole register `_`
   - Last search pattern register `/`
   - you already know about `=`, `system()`, etc. and `+` and `*`
 16. `:&&` and `:~` repeat the last sbustitute and redo the substitute with the last search (whew) 
 17. `&` in normal mode repeats last sub without its range and flags. `g&` 
 18. Marks. Don't forget marks. Special marks:
   `'<` `'>`
 19. `\`[` `]`  first/last character previousl yyanked content marks
 20. Double-backslash move to position before the latest jump
 21. Move the position to where closed file last time
 22. ``^` 
 23. Fuck. Digraphs with `CTRL+K` are a thing
